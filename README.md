# 3D Game with Raycasting

Creating a 3D game using raycasting can be an exciting project. Raycasting is a technique commonly used in older games like Wolfenstein 3D to create the illusion of 3D environments. This repository provides a step-by-step guide to help you develop your own raycasting game.

## Tasks

Here are the tasks you can complete to build your raycasting game:

0. Walls
1. Orientation
2. Rotation
3. Move
4. Ouch!
5. Parser
6. Draw the map
7. Coding Style + Documentation
8. Textures
9. Multi-task!
10. Ground Textures
11. Weapons
12. Enemies
13. Make it Rain
14. Extra option

For detailed information on each task, please refer to the [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) file.

## Getting Started

To get started with the development of your raycasting game, follow these steps:

1. Choose a programming language and framework that supports 3D graphics and raycasting. Some popular options include Unity (C#), Unreal Engine (C++), or Godot (GDScript or C#).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Review the tasks outlined in the [TASKS.md](TASKS.md) file and start working on them one by one.
4. Use the provided examples and resources to guide you through the implementation of each task.
5. Commit and push your changes to your own repository on GitHub.
6. Keep testing and refining your game, gathering feedback from playtesters, and iterating on your design based on their suggestions.
7. Document your code and ensure it follows the coding style guidelines of your chosen programming language or framework.
